# GOES-R Video Generator
This is a simple video-generator leveraging the wonders of free online stuff.
It uses the GOES-R red, blue, and veggie bands to generate a near-realtime, true-color
video of the past few days of weather.

With the most recent GOES satellites, NOAA has been posting near-realtime imagery to this
[Google Cloud bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcp-public-data-goes-16) for public use.

Google also offers a very small VPS as a free demo, which I used to set the project up.
See it live at [bluemarble.nitk.in](http://bluemarble.nitk.in)!

People usually discuss the frameworks they used, but this is pretty basic.
It uses the latest in Javascript, HTML, and Python,
with a bit of shell and make thrown in for good measure.

This code should be fairly easy to use - you'll need to modify paths to remove my username,
but everything works!

# Details
The project consists of three largely independent components:
 - Image processing
 - Video generation
 - HTTP server
Cron acts as a job supervisor to hold everything together. (Again, quick and dirty).

## Image processing
GOES16.sci.py implements the image processing. When started, it goes into an infinite loop:
   - Poll the Cloud Bucket API
   - Check that all images are time-synchronized
   - Check if images have changed
   - If so, process into a JPG file
   - If not, wait 5 minutes and try again.

Image processing is a fairly simple pipeline. For each layer (red, blue, veggie):
   - Download the layer
   - Convert from netCDF4 to netCDF3
      - netCDF4 is newer, but the Python bindings for it are 5x slower than the netCDF3 libraries.
      - nccopy is used for the conversion
   - Scale to a managable size
      - layers start as 10848 pixels square, which swamps the VPS
   - Ensure all values are positive
      - Negatives show up sometimes and mess up gamma correction
   - Apply gamma correction
      - Fancy word for taking x^0.55 for each pixel value
   - Convert from numpy array to a PIL image
      - Saves space and prepares for final formatting

Finally, the images are combined
   - Create a green channel using red, blue, and veggie
   - Stack the layers to make a composite
   - Scale down to a thumbnail size for video-ing

## Video generation
The video generation is as dumb as a rock. `Cron` periodically calls a makefile;
the makefile checks whether the videos need regeneration, and they're rebuilt if so.

Refer to the `crontab` sample for cron rules. The makefile `video.mk` allows cron to
call the script every few minutes without undue overhead.

The script `videogen.py` looks at all the files in the output directory, finds the newest
(up to a configured limit) and compiles them into a video with ffmpeg.

The length of the video and output filename are configured programatically by the FRAMES
dictionary. `day`, `two-day`, `week`, `month`, and `year` all do about what you'd expect.

## HTTP Server
The final component of the whole setup is a simple Python HTTP server. You could use Apache
(or Nginx, or anything else), but on a disk-constrained server, I chose to use what was installed.

It just hosts `index.html` and the videos.

The HTML file allows a user to select between the different generated videos, and automatically
refreshes the videos to keep them near realtime.

## Glue
`Cron` provides the glue for this project. The rules included periodically run the video generator,
and will automatically restart both the HTTP server and the image processor if either die.
